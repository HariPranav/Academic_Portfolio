# App for Getting started with Tech

Lets create a cross platform app which contains links to various important resources to get started with becoming a
developer

# Prerequisites

Install flutter from the link below

[Install flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)

What is Flutter ??

Flutter is Googleâ€™s UI toolkit for building beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.

Say what?? a single framework for web , mobile , desktop ?? Even on a Raspberry Pi : >

The basics of Flutter can be learned in the link below

[Flutter Basics](https://github.com/HariPranav/Flutter)

[Flutter Advanced](https://github.com/HariPranav/flutter_learning_path)

# Create a new project in flutter

    $ flutter create my_project_name

# Main Screens of the App

# First Screen

![Carousel](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HariPranav/BENIMAGES/master/Screenshot_1562742355.png)

### Carousel Widget

This is the first screen that the user is greeted with , it contains three images with a scrollable list of items

Go to the pubspec yaml and add the dependencies

 dependencies:

   flutter:

     sdk: flutter

   carousel_pro: ^1.0.0

   webview_flutter:


Then import this package in your main.dart along with the code below to create a carousel

    import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
    import 'package:carousel_pro/carousel_pro.dart';
    import 'package:webview_flutter/webview_flutter.dart';

    void main(List<String> args) {
    runApp(
        MaterialApp(
        debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false,
        home: MyApp(),
        ),
    );
    }

    class MyApp extends StatefulWidget {
    @override
    _State createState() => _State();
    }

    class _State extends State<MyApp> {
    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
        return MaterialApp(
        debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false,
        home: Scaffold(
            body: new Carousel(
            boxFit: BoxFit.fitWidth,
            images: [
                new NetworkImage("https://dogecoin.com/imgs/doge.png"),
                new NetworkImage(
                    'https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/njmacjXG5DhDcvSpCy6xd584sMRXIwoFxXliEZitBH4OqvK4IT_Zfi6DOuUQcsZNBeURhMtJoBhpLiiTqq6HL3yWmV9Kbpeq0LNbtxLANgAoYfk8rzJMsBYrzSKfTxyQp5Fw499f'),
                new NetworkImage(
                    'https://blockchainedu.org/static/media/ben-full-logo.3f23ec07.png'),
            ],
            animationDuration: Duration(seconds: 5),
            ),
            floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
            onPressed: () {
                Navigator.push(context,
                    MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => SecondScreen()));
            },
            child: Icon(Icons.arrow_forward),
            backgroundColor: Colors.black,
            ),
        ),
        );
    }
    }



# Second Screen Of the app:

![Second Screen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HariPranav/BENIMAGES/master/Screenshot_20200629-014137.jpg)

In the body field of the material App we have a list view widget , which is basically a scrollable list of items ,
It can have many children

Next we have a card which is wrapped with an inkWell so that the entire card when clicked anywhere can open a link or a website , We use the onTapped property to navigate to a specific webview in the app without shifting to a browser

    class SecondScreen extends StatefulWidget {
        @override
        _SecondScreenState createState() => _SecondScreenState();
        }

        class _SecondScreenState extends State<SecondScreen> {
        @override
        Widget build(BuildContext context) {
            return MaterialApp(
            debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false,
            home: Scaffold(
                backgroundColor: Colors.black,
                appBar: AppBar(
                title: Text('Free Courses'),
                backgroundColor: Colors.black,
                ),
                floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
                onPressed: () {
                    Navigator.push(context,
                        MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => Documentation()));
                },
                child: Icon(Icons.arrow_forward),
                backgroundColor: Colors.black,
                ),
                body: ListView(
                children: <Widget>[
                    InkWell(
                    onTap: () {
                        Navigator.push(
                            context, MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => Ben()));
                    },
                    child: Card(
                        child: Column(
                        mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.min,
                        children: <Widget>[
                            ListTile(
                            leading: new Image.network(
                                "https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/black-square-logo-color-300x300.png",
                                height: 300,
                                width: 150,
                            ),
                            title: Text('BEN'),
                            subtitle: Text(
                                'The Blockchain Education Network (BEN) is the largest and longest running network of students, alumni, professors, across the world.'),
                            ),
                        ],
                        ),
                    ),
                    ),
                ],
                ),
            ),
            );
        }
        }

So as we have used multiple cards to link to different websites as shown below to add another website or card copy the inkwell component and add it within the ListViewBuilder


# Webview

![Ben](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HariPranav/BENIMAGES/master/Screenshot_20200629-014201.jpg)

As we can see in the above OnTap property in the Inkwell property we navigate to a webview but how do we implement one ???


Simple we have already imported our dependencies and we need to create a stateless widget to link the OnTap handler

    class Ben extends StatelessWidget {
    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
        return MaterialApp(
        home: Scaffold(
            appBar: AppBar(
            title: Center(child: Text("BEN")),
            ),
            body: WebView(
            initialUrl: 'https://blockchainedu.org/',
            javascriptMode: JavascriptMode.unrestricted,
            ),
        ),
        );
    }
    }

This provides the webview for the app by opening  a browser within the app itself without opening the browser by leaving the app !!!


# Third Screen

In the second screen of the app we have seen that there are several online free resources to learn about blockchain and different technologies .

Its time to put those practical skills to use !! We need to follow a specific guide to develop an app or a product

Hence our third screen has a list of documentation website of popular websites

# Fourth Screen:

Once we have learnt how to build a working prototype lets launch it in a real world scenario !!

The fourth screen has a list of hackathons !!

Ever wonder what a hackathon is ??

Don't worry , Check out this blog on a Beginners Guide to Hackathons

# Conclusion

We now   have a cross platform app  built using only three widgets , WICKED

The complete code can be found in the link below , gitclone and run the pub get in the pubspeck yaml file to successfully run the app
