I am actively looking for full time positions in the domain of Security/ Cloud / Data Engineering and Analytics. As a product security specialist, I take a proactive approach to anticipate and prevent security issues from arising. I have a proven track record of successfully implementing security controls, conducting code reviews, and collaborating with cross-functional teams to integrate security best practices into the development lifecycle. I understand the importance of balancing security requirements with usability and performance to deliver seamless user experiences.



My experience extends beyond traditional security measures to encompass cloud security, application security, and data protection. I stay updated with the latest industry trends and emerging technologies to stay one step ahead of potential threats. Additionally, I am well-versed in compliance frameworks and standards such as ISO 27001, NIST, and GDPR, ensuring that organizations I work with adhere to necessary security regulations. I actively contribute to open source security tools and worked on AWS Prowler, Scout Suite, Apache Superset etc.

Outside work I love to participate and volunteer at Hackathons and I have won a few of them!. I am actively working on research projects and have published papers on the application of blockchain in governance.
