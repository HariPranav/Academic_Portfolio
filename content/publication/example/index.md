abstract: |-
  Farmer Suicides are a major issue in India due
  to various factors. One of the major concerns being the
  financial aspect of managing and growing the crops while
  still trying to turn a profit. This paper proposes a
  decentralised platform for buying and selling of
  agriculture produce by connecting farmers with
  individuals interested in investing in their fields with the
  continuous monitoring of the quality and crop health
  using IOT and Machine Learning for predicting diseases
  in the agricultural produce.
